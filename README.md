# Progressive sequence of cmake examples.

Examples here are c++ focused.

Reflects strong preference for control + flexibility;
assumes reader wants to build/support an ecosystem of related artifacts
that build in a similar way

Intending to navigate various stumbling blocks I encountered
over a couple of years of trying things;
and to provide an opinionated (though possibly flawed) version of best practice

## Topics
1. lsp integration.
   tested with emacs
2. github actions
3. executables, shared libraries, interdependencies
4. header-only libraries
5. monorepo build
   limitations of monorepo build
6. separable build (+ find_package() support)
   limitations of separable build
7. versioning, explicit codebase dependencies, build isolation
8. pybind11 + python issues
   binary API dependence

## Progression
1. c++ executable X
2. c++ executable X + outside library O, using find_package()
3. c++ executable X + library A, A -> O, monorepo-style.
   X,A in same repo + build together.
4. c++ executable X + library A, A -> O, separable-style
   provide find_package() support - can build using X-subdir's cmake if A built+installed
5. project-specific macros - simplify
6. project-specific macros - support (monorepo, separable) builds from same tree
7. c++ executable X + library A + library B.
8. c++ executable X + library A + library B + library C, A -> B -> C, C header-only
9. add unit tests + performance benchmarks.
10. add code coverage.
